# earth4all regional model
## All models are wrong, but some are useful
We hope our model, which is under continued development (as long as the money does not run out), is useful in helping to move our society from their self-destructive paths they are currently on. We believe that we have to *understand* the systemic interconnections of the current scourges of humanity: poverty, inequality, lack of empowerment, fossil energy, industrial agriculture and climate change. So that we can then *intervene* in the system towards reaching a better, more just and sustainable future.

The model helps us to keep our thinking straight, at the conceptual level. While we did calibrate the model to 10 different regions from 1980 to 2020, we are not aiming to get the 10th significant digit behind the comma right. Instead, we use the model to provide rigorous internal consistency to the causal stories we, and others, need to tell to transform our way of life.

An interactive systems map (aka as a causal loop diagram, and also under continued development) is available on [kumu.io](https://kumu.io/-/771028#map-EM6dXNVu)

We also hope that it motivates you to improve and extend it â€“ and find bugs and errors.

We use Vensim for our work, to run the model you need the free [Vensim reader]( https://vensim.com/vensim-model-reader/) and the *.vfmx file. This allows you to inspect and run the model, but not save it. 

If you want to make changes to the model and save them, you need the paid Vensim PRO or DSS [versions](https://vensim.com/software/). For that you can use the *human readable* *.mdl file or the *binary* *.vfmx file. We use version 10.1.3. If you want to see historical data, load the file history.vdfx How to do that is explained [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCxblX-fC1I). Note the video uses an older Vensim version when *.vdfx files had the ending *.vdf

You can also translate the model to Python using the open-source [PySD](https://pysd.readthedocs.io/en/master/) software. But note, due to the extensive use of subscripts, the PySD version on a normal office desktop takes *hours* to run. 

You can download the model documented in the standard [SDM-Doc](https://systemdynamics.org/resources-old/sdm-doc/) format. Unzip the file and double click on the *.html file to open the documentation in your current browser. Note the file is huge and on a normal business desktop the mouse takes a noticeable time to respond to movements.
