	~	In the base case the model moves carbon from biomass to the atmosphere. \
		This is opposite of what the IPCC AR5 Fig 6-08 suggests, where "land" is a \
		sink. The source of that figure is \
		http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/14/data.htm Download the \
		Excel sheet to get the detailed sources in addition to the data. The tab \
		"Terrestrial Sink" gives the numbers for the "land". While it lists 9 \
		models that provide data from 1959 onwards, it actually generates a \
		residual (col B) that is close, but not identical, to the mean value of \
		the models. I looked at one of the models (ISAM) in detail, PDF here: \
		http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/4/333/2013/esd-4-333-2013.html and found, \
		as far as I understand, that only when PFT (plant functional type) \
		fractions are kept constant (!) (experiment CTL) does the model produce a \
		net flow of land carbon uptake from atmosphere to land which is reported \
		in the Excel sheet. The other experiments are dropped. Thus, at the very \
		least, more research is needed!

	~	Melting is modeled as a function of surface temp, but the heat to melt ice \
		comes mostly from the atmosphere (only floating arctic ice is partially \
		melted through heat in the upper ocean). Since the atmospheric heat \
		reservoir is very tiny, there needs to be an effect from that reservoir to \
		limit melting if and when the reservoir is close to being depleted, for \
		whatever reason. One reason could be the large scale experimental (in this \
		model) release of methane hydrates.

Area equivalent of 1km linear retreat km2=

	~	We assume that the permafrost area sits like a ring around the arctic \
		ocean. The arctic ocean has a radius of about 2100 km, to get to the \
		assumed area of permafrost (of 25 Mkm2), the outer ring needs a diamter of \
		about 3500 km. Second, we assume that permafrost melting occurs from the \
		outer radius linearly inwards. Simple calculations result that a retreat \
		of of 1km towards the pole gives at the other ring an area of about 22 000 \
		km2 and at the inner ring an area of about 13 000 km2. Averaging (which is \

		into the ocean as a fraction of the total Greenland ice AT THE TIME THE \
		SLIDING STARTS, over some time interval.  However, the system is a dynamic \
		one, so if you set the value to slide at, say, 0.8, the model calculates \
		at every solution interval 0.8 divided by the time interval of the total \
		Greenland ice AT THE THEN CURRENT TIME, not AT THE TIME THE SLIDING \
		STARTS.  The sum of the former over the time interval is less (since the \
		total ice continuously gets less) than the 0.8 we wish to slide into the \
		ocean.  Hence the fudge.

	~	This odd variable is meant to capture the fact that heat not only diffuses \

		critically dependent on circulation, down and upwelling.  We don't model \
		that physical process in the required detail (partly because the physics \
		is poorly understood), nor do we allow for the structure of circulation, \
		down and upwelling to change so we need to introduce this effect in a \
		general way, which we do through this 'gradient'.  One consequence is that \
		the warmer part of the ocean will never be equal to the colder part, even \
		if you run the model for tens of thousands of years, or even longer.

		If the rate (of currently 0.01%/yr) doubled every decade, it would reach 1 \
